  Ruby's Learning was inspired by the remarkable growth of my niece, Ruby. It was designed to enhance her academic development through an engaging application 
 focused on teaching the Alphabet and Numbers 1-20.

 This app was designed with a child-friendly UI, focusing on simplicity and interactivity for each user. Tailwind was used to create a more   responsive design for an engaging learning experience. Users can choose between three categories: Alphabet, Numbers 1-10, and Numbers 11-20. Each category features interactive elements to reinforce learning.
